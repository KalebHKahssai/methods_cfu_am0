# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
  * I feel fairly confident in my use of built-in Ruby methods. I feel like it's straightforward, just need more reps to feel fully confident.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
  * On a scale of 1 to 5, I feel that I am about a 3 just because conceptually it hasn't fully clicked. I plan to do some independent research.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
  * I need a further explanation on "!".
